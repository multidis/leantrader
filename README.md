# Lean trader

Running QuantConnect [Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) in a stang-alone Docker container. See [Running Lean on your server](https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/2400/avoiding-vendor-lock-in-running-lean-on-your-server/p1) post by the QuantConnect team.

Note: QuantConnect offers high quality hosting for running trading algorithms. If you do not have any custom automation such as writing files to the disk, uploading logs to cloud buckets etc., consider using their [live trading options](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/live-trading/overview).
